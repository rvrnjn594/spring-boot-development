## What we'll build

Elite Club application, which any browser can connect to.

The initial version of the application will expose one RESTendpoint to return the hardcoded list of Elite Clubs.  
 The subsequent chapter will be improving the application by adding new features.

## What we'll need

For this, we will need an **Integrated Developer Environment (IDE).**

Popular choices include IntelliJ IDEA, Spring Tools, Visual Studio Code, and Eclipse.  
 We will use IntelliJ IDEA for this course.

## Creating our first project

Pivotal web service provides us with tools to generate skeleton projects within a few clicks.  
 Spring Initlializr is one such tool.

> **NOTE:** The steps below are for local setup. On the platform, we have the widget where we will run this code without requiring any IDE or local setup.

#### Step 1 - Spring initializer

#### Step 2 - Import project into IDE

#### Step 3 - Run the application

#### Step 4 - Verify

Congratulations! We have created our first Spring Boot application.

## Live application

The application exposes one simple REST endpoint /clubs that returns the club list.

## Key takeaways

- Pivotal cloud foundry provides the tool to generate the skeleton application.
- It's very easy to create an up-and-running Sprint Boot application.
- Unlike conventional Spring applications, Spring Boot is easier to run and involves fewer steps.
