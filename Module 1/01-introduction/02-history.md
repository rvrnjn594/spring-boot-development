Spring is **framework for enterprise development**.  
 It is similar to J2EE but is way **more popular because of its helper classes**, which makes programming a breeze.

## The rise of Spring

> J2EE has been around since 1999, but it earned a bad reputation because of its use of Enterprise Java Beans (EJB), which were complicated to use and deteriorated the application's performance.  
> Other issues with J2EE included the need to write extensive plumbing code for error handling and JDBC connectivity, and the lack of unit testing support.
>
> The applications were heavyweight beacause all the Java EE features were supported and had to be configured and all dependencies had to be hard-coded as well.

In 2002, Rod Johnson wrote a book outlining a framework that simplified EE development. It was initially called Interface21 before being released as an open source framework.

When Spring made its appearance in 2003, programmers were using J2EE without Java Beans. Spring gained immense popularity in a short amount of time and captured most of the J2EE market share.  
 The EJB functionality was improved in Java EE5 and Java EE6, with the focus being on ease of use.

Java EE8, released in 2017, was the last release after which Oracle decided to transger Java EE to an open source foundation.  
 The community renamed Java EE to Jakarta EE. Functionally speaking, Jakarta EE9 is essentially the same as Java EE8. New functionality has been added in Jakarta EE10.

## Developement timeline

Spring has gained alot of momentum since the launch of Spring 1.0 in 2004.

By the time Spring 2.0 was released in 2006, Spring had surpassed 1 milliom downloads!  
 Spring 2.0 removed complexities from XML config files. The next version, Spring 2.5, introduced annotation configurations.

Spring 3.0, released in 2009, set the minimum Java requirement to Java 5 and provided built-in REST support.  
 Spring 3.2 introduced Java configuration and got rid of web.xml.

In 2012, the Spring Mobile and Spring Android projects were released.  
In 2013, Spring 4.0 came around.  
 This was same year Spring Boot 1.0 was introduced to remove complexities associated with creating a web application.  
 Spring Boot configures all the required Spring components and sets up dependencies in Gradle/Maven along with configuring the required beans using either xml, annotations, or Jav code.

Spring 5.0 came out in 2017. It sets the minimum Java requirement to Java 8.

Spring Boot 2.0 was released in 2018.

> The current version of the framework, Spring 6.0 released at the end of 2022, comes with major revision of the core framework.  
>  It uses Jakarta EE9 as a baseline and provides access to the newer versions of web containers (like Tomcat 10).
>
> It requires JDK 17 to work. This enables Spring 6 to take advantage of the new features of Java 17. At the same time, Spring Boot 3.0 came out which is compatible with Spring 6.0.

Spring has simplified application development and its ease of use has led to widespread adoption of the framework.  
 Spring Boot enables users to create a project with all required dependencies automatically wired in.
