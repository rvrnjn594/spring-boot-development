# The Complete Guide to Spring 5 and Spring Boot 2

## Module Overview

In this module, we will get familiar with Spring 5 and Spring Boot 2 to add dependency injection into our applications.  
The module starts with the basics of Spring, like dependency injection, auto-wiring, and constructor injection.  
After covering the basics, we'll move to Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring JDBC, and Spring Data JPA.  
Then, we'll delve into Spring's support for AOP, unit testing, and the MVC architecture.  
By the end of this module, we will have a broad set of tools to work with to create applications that have dependency injection and inversion of control.

## Module Objectives

- An understanding of Spring Boot and its application in the development process.
- Familiarity with the core components of the Spring MVC architecture.
- Hands-on experience interacting with databases using Spring's support for JDBC and JPA.
- The ability to implement cross-cutting concerns in Spring using AOP.
