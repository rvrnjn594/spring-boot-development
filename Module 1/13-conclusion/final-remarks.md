Congratulations! You've completed "The complete guide to spring boot 5 and spring boot 2" module.

## Summary

In this module, we covered the basics of Spring (dependency injection, auto-wiring, and constructor injection.)  
 Subsequently, we discussed various Spring-based projects (Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring JDBC, and Spring Data JPA) used for developing Java applications.  
 Finally, we looked at Spring's support for AOP, unit testing, and the MVC architecture.

## What's next?

Now that we have a basic understanding of the Spring framework, we will learn how to build enterprise applications in the next module, **"Building Enterprise Applications with Spring Boot".**
