This lesson assumes that the database is installed and the schema is properly populated.

## 1. Replacing the H2 dependency

The first step is to remove the H2 dependency from pom.xml and replace it with the dependency of the database we wish to connect to.  
Suppose we wish to connect to MySql.  
The dependency for MySql is given below.  
Dependencies for other databases are available online.

        <dependency>
            <groupId>mysql</groupId>
            <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
        </dependency>

## 2. Configuring property values

For any databases, we need to configure its URL, username, and password. These values are specified in the application.properties.

        spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none
        spring.datasource.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/movie_example
        spring.datasource.username = demo
        spring.datasource.password = demo

Since we already have a schema and do not want Hibernate to create it for us, we have set spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto setting to none.  
 Other options for this setting are create-only, drop, create, validate, and update.

Hibernate would look at the entities and create the schema itself (after dropping any already existing schema.)  
 The username and password are used to connect to the data source.

After making these changes, restart the application and Spring Boot will connect to the database of your choice.  
 This shows how switching from an in-memory databases to a real database is simple in Spring Boot.
