# Spring Boot Development for Java Programmers

The Spring Boot framework is quite a popular framework for developing web applications with reduced coding and more flexibility.  
 These characteristics make Spring Boot a sought-after framework for web development today.

This Skill Path will look at the Spring framework and at how to build Java applications using it.

> You will start with the fundamentals of Spring (**dependency injection, auto-wiring, and constructor injection**), followed by an introduction to Spring-based projects (**Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring JDBC, and Spring Data JPA**).
>
> You will then focus on Spring's support for **AOP, unit testing, and the MVC architecture**.
>
> Moving ahead, you will use different **combinations of the Spring-based projects covered to create easily scalable applications**.
>
> Finally, you will learn **how to use OAuth2 with Spring to add an authentication service** to your applications.

By the end of this Skill Path, you'll have job-ready skills to confidently use Spring Boot in your next project.
